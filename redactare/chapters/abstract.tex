This work has the goal to verify the correctness propositional 
logical algorithms while providing a comparison between the 
languages used in obtaining the demonstrations. By correct we 
understand both the lack of errors at run time and the concordance 
between what the program does and the authors intents.

In practice, an attempt of proving the correctness of a program 
is done by testing but there are instances of complex problems 
where this is not enough.

 

We present two computer-verified implementations of the CNF
conversion for propositional logic. The two implementations are
fully verified: functional correctness and termination is
machine-checked using the Dafny language while only one of them 
is also implemented in scala. The first approach is
based on repeatedly applying a set of equivalences and is often
presented in logic textbooks. The second approach is based on
Tseitin's transformation and is more efficient. We present the main
ideas behind our formalization and we discuss the main difficulties
in verifying the two algorithms.
