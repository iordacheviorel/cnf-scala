\emph{First contribution.} The thesis provides a practical comparison between Dafny and Stainless Scala
by implementing the same algorithm in both tools. I believe the findings obtained can be used in educational 
ways by other students who want to approach a tool specific for formal verification.

\emph{Second contribution.} We prove, using Stainless Scala, that the algorithm based on applying 
in a recursive way nine propositional equivalences is functionally corect. The most difficult part
of the verification was to prove that the recursion terminates. In order to do so, I use a 5-tuple
variant that denotes the decreasing measure which was already defined as part of my bachelor's thesis. todo cite

After surveying the literature specific in this domain, I could not find another proof of the termination
of the nine rules approach neither on paper nor computer-checked. Other approaches that we find apply
the rules in a specific order. For example, a simpler solution would be to remove the implications and 
double implications and then obtaining the NNF using the rules related to removing negations.
