Both tools come with advantages and disadvantages. One may choose one over the other
based the nature of the algorithm he wants to verify. 

If the verification time is important and the implementation suffers a lot of changes
then Dafny would be the better choice. At the opposite, if the proofs are written in an 
incremental approach, without too many changes once formulated, Stainless is also a viable option.

When it comes to the level of autonomy, Dafny excels at proving smaller properties 
by default, while Stainless offers better support for assertions where we are also
able to specify their scope. These differences may become relevant in certain circumstances but
both tools will need our help for more \emph{complex} proofs.

There is still room for improvement when it comes to the support offered through predefined
datastructures and functions.
None of them contain support for common math operations, like the power function which is used often
times in the implemenation. The Stainless library offers limited support for collections and math
functions.
