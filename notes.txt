1. cache on verifications (700 in 20 seconds turn into 4.2 after compiling 10-20 times)

2. you have to use BigInt(0) instead of just *0*. the error for not using the proper constructor in the function is not very detailed 
Error thrown at ensuring stage instead of the base case:
> [ Error  ] cnf.scala:58:9: missing parameter type
>                   res => res >= 0

3. use @induct when defining recursive functions. It comes as a big aid when proving properties of the given recursive function and of the ones that use it.
It can also automatically prove simple "decreases" annotations.
